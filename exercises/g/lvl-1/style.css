.container {
  /* TODO 1: turn this element into a flexbox with "display: flex;"

  Because we gave the children a minimum width, for narrow screens they oveflow and look bad
  */

  /* TODO 2: If elements don't fit the current row, make them go to the next row (wrap them)

  For this you need to use "flex-wrap: wrap;"

  flex-wrap by default has a value of "nowrap"

  You can read more about flex-wrap if you want: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap

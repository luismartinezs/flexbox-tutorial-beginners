  /* TODO 1: turn this element into a flexbox with "display: flex;" */

.item2 {
  /* TODO 2: Use the flex property to make item 2 fill as much space as possible, with "flex: 1;"

  Giving an element the style "flex: 1;" is like telling the flexbox: "take all the space available and fill it with this item"

  The other items remain only as big as their content, by default

  You'll learn more about the flex property later

  Add "flex" to your cheatsheet!

  /* TODO 1: Flexboxes are used to create layouts with items in one dimension (either rows or columns)

  Turn this element into a flexbox with "display: flex;"

  Now save this file, and take a look at the browser window (you might need to refresh the browser).

  Get used to do this. After a change, save, and see what that change does.

  So, what happened?

  Children are displayed in a row. That's because by default the children of flexboxes are displayed in rows.

  I'd tell you to write a note about this in your cheatsheet, but it's already there!

  /* TODO 2: use the justify-content property to center its children: "justify-content: center;"

  Justify-content positions the children elements inside the flexbox along the "main axis".

  Usual values of justify-content are:
    center (center children)
    flex-start (position children at the start / left side)
    flex-end (position children at the end / right side)
    space-between (position children leaving space in between them)

  The main axis is the horizontal axis, by default.

  Write one short sentence in your cheatsheet about justify-content and the main axis.

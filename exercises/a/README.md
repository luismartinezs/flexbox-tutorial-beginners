# Exercise A

Difficulty: ‚≠ê

Hi adventurer, and welcome to this tutorial!

I hope you know some basics about `html` and `css`. Do you at least know what a `div` and a `css class` are? You do? Then, let's continue.

But even if you don't know, this tutorial is basic enough that you might manage anyway.

Inside the lvl-1 folder, you will find an `index.html` file. Look at its content.

The important bit is this part:

```html
<nav class="container">
  <div class="item1">Item 1</div>
  <div class="item2">Item 2</div>
  <div class="item3">Item 3</div>
</nav>
```

A `nav` with a class `container`, and 3 children with classes `item1`, `item2` and `item3`.

Keep those classes in mind to add styles to the container and to the children during the exercises!

Open the `index.html` file in a browser.

You'll see there are some fancy colors and layout already. If you're wondering, these come from the `basic.css` file a couple folders above us. You don't have to bother with it, it's just to make things beautiful.

Now open the file `style.css` and complete the TODOs.

Good luck! And when you're done, try `lvl-2`. Then `lvl-3` and so on.

In this exercise you'll learn how to turn an element into a **flexbox** with the **display property**, and how to arrange the flexbox children along the horizontal axis with **justify-content**. You'll also see the "main axis" mentioned.

# Exercise H

Difficulty: ⭐⭐

In this exercise you'll learn a whole lot more about the flex property:

- The flex property is a shorthand. You'll learn about the properties flex-basis, flex-grow and flex-shrink
- You'll learn how to use the flex property to set the base size of each flexbox child, and how to set the rate at which they grow and shrink relative to each other, when the size of the flexbox changes.

# Instructions

This **flexbox tutorial** is aimed at html and css students that are brand new to flexbox. No flexbox knowledge is required, but some very basic html and css skills are assumed.

You will learn the basics of flexbox by repeating exercises with progressive difficulty.

I want to give credit to this video from freecodecamp for providing me with ideas about the layouts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wlt8NRtOpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wlt8NRtOpo)

## How to use this tutorial

1. Install VSCode (highly recommended, but you could use a plain text editor too) [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Open the folder for this tutorial with VSCode
   - Open VSCode
   - Click on File > Open Folder
   - Select the folder that contains all the files for this tutorial
3. Go to the first exercise, inside `exercises/a`, and right click on the `README.md` file you’ll find inside, then `Open Preview` (you can also see the same information in this document, below, so leave this file open on the side).
4. There you can read a brief description of the exercise, and see how the final result should look like.
5. Then go into the `exercises/a/lvl-1`. You'll see an `index.html` that helps you visualize the exercise, and a `style.css` file.
6. To view an exercise in the browser, you can just open the index.html file in a browser window.
   - I recommend you install this VSCode extension: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), if you do, then you can just right click the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live server`.
7. Open the file `style.css` and complete any TODOs in order. In lvl 1, you'll "learn the theory". You can delete the TODOs as you go.
   - After completing each TODO, it’s a good idea to save and take a look at the page, so that you see what each thing does
8. You completed an exercise if your solution looks like the one in the `README.md` or like in the images below.
9. Beyond level 1, you'll be less hand-held. Progress to the top!
10. When you finish with a, move to b, and so on.
